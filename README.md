# airbnb-clone-project
# Overview

This project is a full-featured clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to simulate the core functionalities of the real application. It allows users to browse and book accommodations, manage listings, authenticate securely, leave reviews, and more. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building scalable, real-world web applications by replicating a popular product.

# Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations..


# Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Team Roles

Backend Developer: Builds and maintains the server-side logic of a web application. e.g Implements authentication, data validation, and performance optimizations.

Database Administrator: Manages and maintains databases to ensure they’re secure, fast, and reliable. e.g Designs and manages the structure of databases.

DevOps Engineer: Bridges the gap between development and operations by automating infrastructure and deployments. e.g Sets up CI/CD pipelines for automatic testing and deployment.

QA Engineer: Ensures the product is free of bugs and meets the requirements before it goes live. e.g Writes and executes test cases (manual and automated).

title 

description

price_per_night

rating

A property belongs to one host (User).

A property can have multiple bookings.

A property can have multiple reviews.

3. Bookings

id (Primary Key)

guest (Foreign Key to Users)

property (Foreign Key to Properties)

check_in_date

check_out_date

A booking belongs to one property.

4. Reviews

Key Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user (Foreign Key to Users)

property (Foreign Key to Properties)

rating (1 to 5)

comment

Relationships:

A review belongs to one user.

A review is linked to one property.

5. Payments

id (Primary Key)

booking (One-to-One Field to Bookings)

payment_date

amount

status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)

Relationships:

A payment is linked to one booking.

# Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
All API endpoints are clearly documented using tools like Swagger or Postman collections. This helps frontend developers and third-party clients understand how to interact with the system efficiently.

2. User Authentication
Secure registration, login, and logout using JWT authentication. Users can have different roles (host or guest), and access control is enforced throughout the platform.

3. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each property contains relevant details such as title, price, description, location, images, and availability status.

4. Booking System
Guests can check availability and make bookings for listed properties. The system handles check-in/check-out dates, prevents double bookings, and calculates total price based on stay duration.

5. Payment Processing
Supports secure payment integration (e.g., Flutterwave or Stripe). Guests must complete payment before a booking is confirmed, and transactions are tracked through a dedicated Payments model.

6. Review System
Guests who have completed a stay can leave ratings and written reviews. Reviews help future guests make informed decisions and give feedback to property hosts.

7. Database Optimizations
Efficient indexing, query optimization, and use of select_related/prefetch_related in Django ensure the app remains fast and scalable as data grows.

# API Security

1. Authentication

Why it's important: Ensures that only registered users can log in and access personal features like bookings, payments, and profile management.

2. Authorization

Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized actions, such as a guest attempting to edit another user’s listing or access private data.

3. Rate Limiting

Why it's important: Prevents brute-force attacks on login, abuse of the API, and denial of service (DoS) attempts.

4. HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

Why it's important: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures secure data transmission between the client and server.

5. Secure Payments

Why it's important: Protects sensitive financial data and ensures transaction integrity and user trust.

6. Session & Token Expiry

Why it's important: Minimizes the risk if a token is compromised.

7. Database Access Control

Why it's important: Prevents data breaches, accidental deletions, and internal misuse.

# CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. With CI/CD pipelines, every change made to the codebase can be automatically tested and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention.

Why It Matters
Speed: Enables faster release cycles by automating builds and deployments.

Reliability: Automated tests catch bugs before code reaches production.

Consistency: Ensures that every deployment follows the same steps and environment setup.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment workflows triggered by events like push or pull requests.

Docker: Standardizes the environment, making it easy to build, test, and deploy across different platforms.

PostgreSQL + Redis: Automatically provisioned as part of the deployment stack for production readiness.
