# airbnb-clone-project
# Overview

This project is a full-featured clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to simulate the core functionalities of the real application. It allows users to browse and book accommodations, manage listings, authenticate securely, leave reviews, and more. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building scalable, real-world web applications by replicating a popular product.

# Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations..


# Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Team Roles

Backend Developer: Builds and maintains the server-side logic of a web application. e.g Implements authentication, data validation, and performance optimizations.

Database Administrator: Manages and maintains databases to ensure theyâ€™re secure, fast, and reliable. e.g Designs and manages the structure of databases.

DevOps Engineer: Bridges the gap between development and operations by automating infrastructure and deployments. e.g Sets up CI/CD pipelines for automatic testing and deployment.

QA Engineer: Ensures the product is free of bugs and meets the requirements before it goes live. e.g Writes and executes test cases (manual and automated).
